#summary General information about the SBM project.

= Introduction =

Welcome to the project's wiki.  It's still too early to put anything in here, but once that the script is more solid and is almost ready for distribution, I will start documenting its features, functions, etc.


= Details =

This is some of the content that the wiki will have in the future:
  * Script features
  * Installation instructions
  * Getting started
  * List of functions
  * Tips and tricks
  * Common troubleshooting
  * Upcoming changes, additions and improvements

= Credits =

This script wouldn't be possible without the following projects and people.  Some just inspired me, while some others offered advice; and others provided me with the information and tools that make this project what it is.
