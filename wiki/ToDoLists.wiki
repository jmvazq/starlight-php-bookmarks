#summary A list of tasks to complete for the next version or revision of the script.

= To-Do Lists =

Although the script IS functional already, there are still many things I'm not satisfied with.  This is my first project, and it shows.  I want to improve it, the more the better.


== To-Do List for next revision (not a release) ==

  * Completely *redo* the admin panel's *layout*, and get rid of the ugly tables, replacing them with divs and other elements.  This also includes *design*: a *new look*, with new colors, better use of CSS, some graphics and icons, etc.
  * Add *pagination* to the category and link lists at the admin panel.
  * Add *filtering/sorting/search functionality* to the category and link lists at the admin panel, allowing the user to *browse the links (and categories) by specific criteria*, such as a certain category.
  * Attempt to implement *RSS/atom feeds* for the links.
  * Attempt to create a feature that allows to *EXPORT* the links in *CSV* (comma separated value) format, *XML* and/or similar.  (If I manage to do this, I'd also like to include an *IMPORT* feature as well, in order to include bookmarks from some browsers and online bookmarking services.)
  * Add *more flexibility* to user functions *get_category()* and *get_link()*.
  * *Rewrite* user functions *links_count()* and *categories_count()*.
  * *More* to come.
